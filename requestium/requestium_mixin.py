        Selenium needs the driver to be currently at the domain of the cookie
        before allowing you to add it, so we need to get through this limitation.

        The cookie parameter is a dict which must contain the keys (name, value, domain) and
        may contain the keys (path, expiry).

        We first check that we aren't currently in the cookie's domain, if we aren't, we GET
        the cookie's domain and then add the cookies to the driver.

        We can override the cookie's domain using 'override_domain'. The use for this
        parameter is that sometimes GETting the cookie's domain redirects you to a different
        sub domain, and therefore adding the cookie fails. So sometimes the user may
        need to override the cookie's domain to a less strict one, Eg.: 'site.com' instead of
        'home.site.com', in this way even if the site redirects us to a subdomain, the cookie will
        stick. If you set the domain to '', the cookie gets added with whatever domain the browser
        is currently at (at least in chrome it does), so this ensures the cookie gets added.

        It also retries adding the cookie with a more permissive domain if it fails in the first
        try, and raises an exception if that fails. The standard selenium behaviour in this case
        was to not do anything, which was very hard to debug.
